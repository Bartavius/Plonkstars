- hooked up to the backend and it works, but the speed tho...gotta make it faster
    - perhaps make it randomize from a growing database instead of generating.
    - for the development cycle, game mode selection can offer (generate on load ; generate from existing)

- fix phone UI contact card
- find a fix for dimensional travel polyline

- add clickable marker to redirect to actual coords
- add loading page
- add time limit
- get the current round number
- create map functionality
- game mode / settings page
- protected routes so that only logged in users can play
- user guesses are summarized when the "results" page is accessed instead of querying user guess
- return to start button

# future implementations:

- hide and seek mode? each player puts a pin down, people spawn there and has to guess, pictionary-esque
